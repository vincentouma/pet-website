      <p>Nothing beats a long walk with your four-legged friend on a fresh, morning. Or seeing the joy on their faces when you pick up a ball and they know it’s playtime in the local park! Even relaxing at home feels better in each other’s company.

    </p>
    <p>There’s an old saying, which is certainly true, that pets and dogs repay the love you give them ten-fold.</p>
    <h5>benefits of owning a dog</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Studies have found that dog owners have lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol than non-dog owners and are less likely to have minor or serious health problems</li>
        <li>Dog owners generally have a stronger immune system, helping them to stay well and spend less time getting over sickness and bugs. In fact, dog owners visit the doctor less often than non-dog owners, and are less likely to be on medication.</li>
        <li> My fevorite is the company and joy dogs offer you when you got no one .They will offer hugs, smile simpathy and comfort.</li>
